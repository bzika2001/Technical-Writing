## 🔑 The Core Idea

**Technical Writing Two** helps you level up from clear writing to *useful* writing that people can actually follow and trust.

Anyone can write text — but real value comes from docs that:
- Feel consistent and professional  
- Speak to the right audience  
- Have a clear flow and scope  
- Use visuals and examples well  
- Get improved over time

## 🗂️ The Vital 20% — 6 Big Levers

Below are the six habits that deliver the biggest wins, fast.

---

### 1️⃣ Use a Style Guide — and Stick to It

**Why it matters:**  
A style guide is your team’s rulebook for tone, formatting, word choice, headings, and technical terms.  
Without it, everyone writes differently — and readers feel like they’re reading 5 different authors.

**How to apply:**  
- Pick one trusted guide (like Google’s Developer Style Guide).
- Agree on tweaks for your team (local rules, naming conventions).
- Add a *“Style Guide Check”* to your review or Definition of Done.
- Keep it accessible — wiki, repo, or pinned doc.

👉 *Consistency builds trust. Inconsistent writing breaks it.*

---

### 2️⃣ Always Write for the Reader

**Why it matters:**  
Many docs fail because they reflect what *we* know, not what *the reader* needs. If your team writes for themselves, the real user gets lost.

**How to apply:**  
- Start with audience questions in grooming or design: *Who reads this? What’s their skill level?*
- Use simple language for beginners, precise detail for experts.
- Cut anything that doesn’t help the reader act.
- Test with a real user when possible — one confused user is feedback gold.

👉 *The right doc for the right reader saves hours of frustration.*

---

### 3️⃣ Structure Before or After Writing

**Why it matters:**  
Structure turns a brain dump into a doc that flows. Readers shouldn’t have to hunt for what they need.

**How to apply:**  
- Draft a quick outline of headings and steps.
- Write freely if you prefer — but clean it up before sharing.
- Use clear headings that match real tasks: *“Install the Plugin”, “Troubleshoot Errors”*.
- Stick to one idea per section.

👉 *Good structure = easy to skim, easy to find, easy to trust.*

---

### 4️⃣ State Scope and Prerequisites

**Why it matters:**  
A clear opening tells people: *Is this doc for me? Am I ready to use it?*  
No surprises, no wasted time.

**How to apply:**  
- Start docs with lines like: *“This guide shows how to ___. You’ll need ___ first.”*
- If there’s a skill or permission needed, say so upfront.
- Use bullet lists if the prerequisites are technical.

👉 *Clear scope stops support tickets before they start.*

---

### 5️⃣ Show, Don’t Just Tell — Use Smart Visuals and Examples

**Why it matters:**  
Examples and visuals help people “see” what to do, not just read instructions.  
Bad visuals confuse more than help — so use them carefully.

**How to apply:**  
- Explain only *one idea* per diagram.
- Use arrows, callouts, or highlights so readers see what matters.
- Add clear captions: *“This shows how to configure X.”*
- For code, keep examples short, real, and testable.
- Add *anti-examples* when it helps — show what *not* to do.

👉 *Visual + example = faster learning, fewer mistakes.*

---

### 6️⃣ Revise Later — Fresh Eyes Beat First Drafts

**Why it matters:**  
Writers are blind to their own mistakes. It’s normal — that’s why peer reviews exist.

**How to apply:**  
- Don’t ship the first draft. Sleep on it, then re-read.
- Read it aloud. If it’s awkward to say, it’s awkward to read.
- Pair up for peer edits — fresh eyes catch gaps, jargon, or unclear steps.
- Build this habit into your team’s process: *“Who’s your peer editor?”*

👉 *Drafts improve. Good reviews make them great.*

---

## ✅ Where You Fit In as Delivery Manager

Your role is to keep these habits alive:
- **Check:** Are we using the style guide? Did we state the scope? Are visuals clear?
- **Ask:** Who’s the doc for? Will it actually help them?
- **Promote:** Make peer edits normal — pair juniors with seniors.
- **Reinforce:** Shout out good examples in stand-ups. Use real docs as learning moments.

---

## 🏆 Bottom Line

Good docs don’t just appear — they’re *designed*, *structured*, *reviewed*, and *improved*.  
Keep your team focused on these six habits. They’ll deliver the 80% of value that keeps readers happy and your team’s work respected.
