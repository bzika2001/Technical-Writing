## ‚úÖ Why Accessibility Matters

Accessible content allows:
- People with **visual impairments** to understand diagrams using screen readers.
- Users with **temporary injuries** (like a broken arm) to still navigate and consume documentation.
- People in **low-light or high-noise** environments to rely on clear, well-structured content.

---

## üì∑ Add Alt Text to All Images

**Alt text** (alternative text) is used by screen readers to describe an image to visually impaired users.

### Best Practices:
- Write alt text that **summarizes the purpose** of the image, not just its appearance.
- Keep it **brief but informative**.
- If the image is decorative only, use an empty `alt=""` so screen readers can skip it.

```html
<img src="api-flow.png" alt="High-level API request-response flow between client and server">
````

## üé® Use Sufficient Color Contrast

Ensure your text has strong contrast against its background. People with **low vision** or **color blindness** may not be able to distinguish low-contrast content.

### Tools:

* [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
* Use at least **4.5:1** contrast ratio for normal text.

## üëÅÔ∏è Avoid Visual-Only Communication

Don‚Äôt rely solely on **color**, **bold**, or **shapes** to convey meaning.

‚úÖ Do:

> ‚ÄúClick the green **Save** button with the checkmark.‚Äù

‚ùå Don‚Äôt:

> ‚ÄúClick the green button to continue.‚Äù

---

## üß© Use a Proper Heading Structure

Headings allow screen reader users to **navigate quickly**.

### Example:

```markdown
# Page Title
## Section Heading
### Subsection Heading
```

* Don't skip heading levels (e.g., from H2 to H4).
* Use headings semantically ‚Äî not just for size.

---

## üîó Use Descriptive Link Text

Avoid vague links like:

> [Click here](#)

Instead, use:

> [Learn more about accessibility best practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)

This helps users using screen readers understand the **context and purpose** of the link.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Use Clear and Simple Language

Write for a **broad audience**:

* Avoid technical jargon unless your audience expects it.
* Keep sentences short and concise.
* Define complex terms the first time you use them.

---

## üß™ Practice Editing for Accessibility

Before publishing, review content for:

* **Correct heading structure**
* **Proper alt text**
* **Good link labels**
* **Color contrast**
* **Plain language**

Use accessibility checkers or plugins in your writing tools to spot issues early.
