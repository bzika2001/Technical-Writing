## What is a style guide in technical writing?

A **style guide** is a detailed set of rules and conventions designed to keep all technical documentation consistent in language, tone, format, and structure. It acts like a rulebook for writers, editors, and anyone producing technical content.

**Why it matters:**  
- Eliminates unnecessary debates about word choice or formatting.  
- Creates a consistent experience for readers, making docs easier to use.  
- Speeds up writing and reviewing by setting clear standards.  
- Improves readability, accessibility, and translation readiness.

**Key elements typically covered:**  
- Grammar and punctuation rules (e.g., comma usage, hyphenation).  
- Standardized terminology, acronyms, and abbreviations to avoid confusion.  
- Voice and tone guidelines (formal, conversational, empathetic).  
- Formatting for headings, lists, tables, code blocks, images.  
- Document structures suited to different content types (manuals, API docs).  
- Accessibility guidelines to serve all users, including those with disabilities.  
- Legal and compliance requirements where applicable.

This consistent foundation helps technical writers create clear, accurate, and user-friendly documentation.
