# 📘 Supporting Your Team with Technical Writing Basics

As a Delivery Manager, you help create a culture where good writing is normal — not an afterthought. Use these actions to back up what your team learned in **Technical Writing One**.

---

## ✅ 1. Promote Consistency

**How you can help:**  
Set up a shared glossary in your repo or Confluence. Example: agree that you’ll use *API Key* (not *token*, *auth code*, or *key* randomly).

**Tip:**  
Add a quick *“term check”* to your doc review checklist.

---

## 🧭 2. Review for Clarity

**How you can help:**  
Spot lazy pronouns. *“It fails here.”* — what’s *it*? Be that person who asks.

**Tip:**  
Use side-by-side reviews where a teammate just looks for “what’s unclear”.

---

## 🗣️ 3. Champion Active Voice

**How you can help:**  
Remind your team: *“Users install the plugin”* beats *“The plugin is installed by users.”*

**Tip:**  
Keep a real before/after example to show new writers in a retro.

---

## 🎯 4. Push for Specificity

**How you can help:**  
Swap *“handle”* for *“log”*, *“record”*, *“alert”* — which is it really?

**Tip:**  
Keep a “vague vs specific” cheat sheet. Example: *“Do the thing” → “Run the build script.”*

---

## ✏️ 5. Keep it Focused

**How you can help:**  
Ask: *Does this sentence try to say 3 things at once?* Suggest splitting it.

**Tip:**  
Short sentences feel confident. Long ones feel unsure.

---

## 📋 6. Break Up Complex Info

**How you can help:**  
Turn *“To do this you must A, B, and C while D happens if E fails…”* into a clean checklist.

**Tip:**  
Remember: *Steps → numbered. Details → bullets.*

---

## 🧹 7. Trim the Fat

**How you can help:**  
Cut weasel words: *“actually,” “basically,” “very.”* They add no meaning.

**Tip:**  
When in doubt, remove *“really”* — see if anything changes.

---

## 🔢 8. Guide Good Lists

**How you can help:**  
Check:
- Steps use numbers (*1, 2, 3*).
- Bullets for unordered info.
- Each item starts with the same type of word: *Install…*, *Open…*, *Click…*.
- Every list has a clear intro line.

**Tip:**  
*“To do X, follow these steps:”* — simple but works every time.

---

## 📑 9. Strengthen Paragraphs

**How you can help:**  
First line = promise of what’s inside. Don’t bury the point halfway down.

**Tip:**  
Split a muddled paragraph into two clear ones.

---

## 🎯 10. Focus on the Reader

**How you can help:**  
Keep asking: *“Who is this for?”* A junior dev? A client? A senior engineer?

**Tip:**  
Before the team writes, get them to answer: *“After reading this, the user should be able to ___.”*

---

## 🗂️ 11. Plan the Structure

**How you can help:**  
Push for quick outlines first — even sticky notes or a 5-bullet Slack message counts.

**Tip:**  
Save time: outlines stop half-finished docs from wasting your review time.

---

## ⚙️ Practical Next Steps

- Run 15-min peer edit sessions: pick 1 section, fix 1 thing.
- Keep this list pinned in your docs repo.
- Celebrate when someone fixes an old doc using these tips.
- Make “good doc of the month” a thing — share best examples.

---

## 🏆 Summary

Good writing saves time. Better writing builds trust. As a Delivery Manager, you make that happen by reminding, reviewing, and celebrating small wins.
