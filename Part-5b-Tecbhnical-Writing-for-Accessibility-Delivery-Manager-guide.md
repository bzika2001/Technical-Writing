## Why It Matters

Good technical writing should be **clear, usable, and inclusive**. Accessibility ensures:
- Better readability for everyone (not just those with disabilities).
- Lower support tickets from confused users.
- Higher product adoption across diverse audiences.

---

## 1. Lead by Expectation, Not Just Awareness

**Make accessibility a documented team standard**, not a “nice-to-have.”

Include accessibility in your:
- Definition of Done
- Peer review checklist
- Documentation sprints

💡 Example:  
> “All documentation must include alt text, accessible headings, and avoid color-only cues before it’s marked as done.”

---

## 2. Embed Accessibility in Review Workflows

Introduce lightweight review practices:
- Check for alt text on images.
- Ensure logical heading structure (H1 > H2 > H3).
- Avoid vague link text (“Click here” → “Read more about pricing”).
- Ensure color contrast in visuals/screenshots.

---

## 3. Build Writer Awareness Through Small Wins

Start with team-friendly awareness efforts:
- Share a “before and after” document.
- Create a 1-page “5 Accessibility Checks” guide.
- Celebrate “most accessible doc” in team meetings.

---

## 4. Provide Lightweight Training and Resources

Help writers get started:
- Share short clips (e.g. from WebAIM, Google A11y).
- Embed links to cheat sheets in your wiki.
- Host a mini-workshop with a UX writer or accessibility lead.

---

## 5. Run a Quarterly Accessibility Audit

Once a quarter:
- Review recent docs for accessibility issues.
- Document common misses and wins.
- Use results to guide coaching or retros.

---

## 6. Normalize Iteration on Accessibility

Empower your team to:
- Gradually fix older content.
- Track improvements across versions.
- Treat accessibility like refactoring — small steps, big impact.

---

## 7. Tools You Can Bring Into the Workflow

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/) | Accessibility audit for web content |
| [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) | Checks color contrast |
| [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) / [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com) | Improves clarity and readability |
| Markdown Linters | Warns about heading order, missing alt text |

---

## 🏁 Final Advice

- **Start small, but start today.**
- **Bake accessibility into culture, not just tasks.**
- **Progress over perfection.**

As Delivery Manager, you don’t need to be the expert — but you do need to **create the conditions** for your team to write for *everyone*.
