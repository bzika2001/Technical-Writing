# 📘 Supporting Your Team with Technical Writing Basics

As a Delivery Manager, you play a key role in creating an environment where good technical writing is the norm, not the exception. Below are practical ways you can help your team apply what they learned in **Technical Writing One**.

---

## ✅ 1. Promote Consistency

- **How you can help:**  
  Encourage the team to create a shared glossary for common terms and project-specific language.  
- **Tip:**  
  Add a quick check in code reviews or doc reviews for consistent terminology.

---

## 🧭 2. Review for Clarity

- **How you can help:**  
  When reviewing docs, highlight ambiguous pronouns (`this`, `that`, `it`) and ask for clarity.
- **Tip:**  
  Encourage peer reviews focused just on spotting unclear references.

---

## 🗣️ 3. Champion Active Voice

- **How you can help:**  
  Remind writers to check for passive constructions. If you see "is done by," suggest rewriting to active.
- **Tip:**  
  Use examples in team meetings to show the difference.

---

## 🎯 4. Push for Specificity

- **How you can help:**  
  Remind the team: *Vague verbs hide problems*. Prompt them to pick precise verbs.
- **Tip:**  
  Keep a list of vague vs. specific verb pairs handy as a team resource.

---

## ✏️ 5. Keep it Focused

- **How you can help:**  
  In reviews, ask: *Is this sentence doing too much?* Suggest splitting overloaded sentences or paragraphs.
- **Tip:**  
  Encourage short, sharp sentences.

---

## 📋 6. Break Up Complex Info

- **How you can help:**  
  Suggest turning long, hard-to-read sentences into lists.
- **Tip:**  
  Remind the team to choose numbered lists for steps, bullets for unordered points.

---

## 🧹 7. Trim the Fat

- **How you can help:**  
  Remind writers to cut filler words like *basically*, *actually*, *very*.
- **Tip:**  
  Keep an eye out for redundancies during reviews.

---

## 🔢 8. Guide Good Lists

- **How you can help:**  
  Check that lists are:
  - Ordered when steps matter.
  - Bulleted when order doesn’t.
  - Parallel (same grammatical structure).
  - Introduced properly with a lead-in sentence.
- **Tip:**  
  Teach the team to start numbered steps with an action word.

---

## 📑 9. Strengthen Paragraphs

- **How you can help:**  
  Make sure each paragraph has a strong opening sentence that signals the point.
- **Tip:**  
  Suggest merging or splitting paragraphs if multiple ideas get mixed.

---

## 🎯 10. Focus on the Reader

- **How you can help:**  
  Keep asking: *Who’s reading this? What do they need?*
- **Tip:**  
  Before starting a doc, get the team to jot down audience needs and key messages.

---

## 🗂️ 11. Plan the Structure

- **How you can help:**  
  Ask for a quick outline before a doc is written — key points upfront, then supporting details.
- **Tip:**  
  Use outlines in planning sessions to align everyone.

---

## ⚙️ Practical Next Steps

- Schedule short peer review sessions for docs.
- Keep a simple checklist with these points.
- Encourage writing sprints to revise old docs with these principles.
- Celebrate good examples in retros or team meetings.
