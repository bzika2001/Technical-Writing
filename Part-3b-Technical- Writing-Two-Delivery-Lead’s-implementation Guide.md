## 🔑 The Core Idea

**Technical Writing Two** moves you from just writing clearly to writing so people can actually *use* the docs easily.

Good writing here = structure, audience focus, smart visuals, examples, and constant improvement.

---

## 🗂️ The Vital 20% — 6 Big Levers

Below are the six main habits that make the biggest difference.

---

### 1️⃣ Use a Style Guide — and Stick to It

**Why it matters:**  
A style guide keeps everyone’s writing consistent, so docs feel professional and predictable.

**How to apply:**  
- Pick a style guide (e.g., Google’s).
- Share it with the team.
- Use it during reviews: check headings, word choice, formatting.

👉 *No style guide = random writing = confused readers.*

---

### 2️⃣ Always Write for the Reader

**Why it matters:**  
Docs often match what *we* know, not what the reader needs. Always flip it.

**How to apply:**  
- Who’s the reader? New? Expert?  
- What do they *need* to do with this info?  
- What do they already know? What don’t they know?

👉 *Reader-first writing solves real problems.*

---

### 3️⃣ Structure Before or After Writing

**Why it matters:**  
A clear structure stops people from getting lost.

**How to apply:**  
- Make a quick outline first.
- If you write freely, always tidy up the structure at the end.

👉 *Good docs flow logically. Bad docs dump ideas randomly.*

---

### 4️⃣ State Scope and Prerequisites

**Why it matters:**  
People need to know *what this doc covers* and *what they need first*.

**How to apply:**  
- First lines: *“This guide shows you how to ___. You need ___ first.”*

👉 *Clear entry conditions mean no wasted time.*

---

### 5️⃣ Show, Don’t Just Tell — Use Smart Visuals and Examples

**Why it matters:**  
Readers understand faster with clear examples and visuals. Bad ones confuse more than they help.

**How to apply:**  
- One idea per drawing.
- Add a caption that explains *the point*.
- Use arrows/highlights for key parts.
- Code: add short, clear examples *and* anti-examples when useful.

👉 *Good examples + visuals = faster understanding.*

---

### 6️⃣ Revise Later — Fresh Eyes Beat First Drafts

**Why it matters:**  
Writers miss their own mistakes. Fresh eyes see what you can’t.

**How to apply:**  
- Save the draft. Come back later.
- Read aloud — if it’s awkward to say, it’s awkward to read.
- Get a teammate to review it too.

👉 *Peer edits + distance = better docs.*

---

## ✅ Where You Fit In as Delivery Manager

- **Check:** Are these habits being followed?  
- **Ask:** Who’s the reader? Is the doc scoped right? Does it flow?  
- **Promote:** Peer edits. Make them normal.  
- **Reinforce:** Celebrate people who apply these ideas well.

---

## 🏆 Bottom Line

Good docs don’t just happen. They’re planned, scoped, structured, tested, and improved.

If you keep your team focused on these six habits, you’ll get 80% of the benefit from Technical Writing Two.

## ⚙️ Next Step
